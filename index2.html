		<h1> November Picks: The Movies and TV You Can't Miss </h1>
		<h2>  | Available Friday, November 6, on VOD </h2>
		<p>Eva Green plays Sarah, an astronaut training for a year-long space mission. The training places a strain on her relationship with her daughter, which begins to take its toll as her mission's launch date nears. </p>
		<p> Eva Green is truly made of stars, and the recent misfire that was Penny Dreadful: City of Angels " still has me wondering why that show's creators didn't reanimate Vanessa Ives  for a second go-round. Alice Winocour , who always scripts strong main characters, and has a flair for sound design and environments. Check out her earlier films Disorder and Augustine , as well as Best Foreign Language Oscar nominee  (she co-wrote its screenplay).  </p>
